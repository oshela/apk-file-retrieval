If you've installed an Android application on your phone using Android Studio's "Run" or "Debug" option, the APK file is usually generated and installed directly on your device without being saved as a separate file on your phone. In this case, you won't find the APK file in your phone's storage because it's stored in a system directory.

 **Use ADB (Android Debug Bridge):** If you have developer tools installed on your computer and USB debugging enabled on your phone, you can use ADB to pull the APK file from your device. Here's a general outline of the steps:

   a. Connect your phone to your computer via USB.

   b. Open a command prompt or terminal window on your computer.

   c. Run the following command to list all installed packages on your device and find the package name of the app you want:
   
      ```
      adb shell pm list packages
      ```

   d. Once you've identified the package name, run the following command to pull the APK to your computer (replace `com.example.app` with the actual package name of the app):

      ```
      adb pull /data/app/com.example.app-1/base.apk
      ```

   e. This will save the APK file to your computer.
